# 🌟 QA Portfolio by **Hajrudin Karajčić**

Hello, I’m **Hajrudin Karajčić** — a motivated QA Engineer who brings **precision, analytical mindset and a relentless focus on quality**.  
With a 6-month immersive QA training backed by hands-on projects, I offer real-world testing skills in manual testing, API automation, database validation and UI automation with Cypress.

In today’s fast-paced software industry, teams need QA professionals who can **reduce time to market without compromising quality**, **find issues early and clearly explain them**, and **leverage automation to scale testing efforts**. That’s exactly what I bring:  
- I deliver clear test documentation and practical bug reports that empower developers and reduce rework.  
- I validate APIs, write SQL queries to check backend integrity, and ensure data flows correctly.  
- I build maintainable Cypress automation frameworks to accelerate regression cycles and free up your team for higher-value testing.

Explore my portfolio to see how I turn test cases into quality-driven results, and how I can help your team ship confidently, faster and smarter.
